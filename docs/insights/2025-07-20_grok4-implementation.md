## Details

### Agent Architecture Overview

#### **Supervisory Agent** (Master Controller)

  - Logs all decisions with time and trace ID
  - Uses UTC time standardization
  - Logic-based decision making ("not emotion or adjectives")

#### **HubSpot Routing Agent** (CRM Integration)
- **Role:** Direct HubSpot CRM field updates
- **Function:** "Read from sheet. Apply field update to matching HubSpot Deal ID. Confirm success in log."
- **Tools:** HubSpot API integration
- **Sheet Reference:** HubSpot_Routing_Agent_Sheet.xlsx
- **RAG Enabled:** No (direct execution agent)

#### **Document Editor Agent** (Content Management)
- **Role:** Document creation and modification
- **Configuration:** Standard agent config with RAG disabled
- **Purpose:** Automated document generation and updates

#### **Folder Architect Agent** (File Organization)

- **Integration:** Works with Google Drive and local filesystem

#### **Audit Logging Agent** (Compliance & Tracking)
- **Role:** Complete action logging and audit trail
- **Purpose:** Business compliance and process tracking
- **Features:** Time-stamped activity logs

#### **Folder Correction Agent** (Error Handling)
- **Role:** File organization error detection and correction
- **Function:** Automated cleanup and structure validation

### Automation Workflow Architecture

#### **Service Dependency Automation:**
```
Credit Analysis → Financial Prep → Loan Acquisition
      ↓              ↓               ↓
   Auto-create   Auto-create   Auto-create
   linked deal   linked deal   linked deal
```

#### **Multi-Service Bundle Management:**
- Automatic deal splitting for bundled services
- Bundle discount calculation (5-15% based on count)
- Parent-child deal relationship creation
- Service-specific revenue tracking

#### **Revenue Protection Workflow:**
1. Contract Signed → Payment Link Generation
2. Payment Confirmation → Processor Assignment
3. Milestone Tracking → Performance Monitoring
4. Service Completion → Next Service Trigger

### Technical Implementation Details

#### **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Framework:**
- **RAG_Primer.txt:** "All agents must read this before performing any task"
- **Operating Principles:**
  - Logic-based decisions (not emotion-driven)
  - Question-asking when intent unclear
  - Confirmation before breaking existing flows
  - UTC time standardization
  - Complete action logging

#### **Time Reference Protocol:**
- Standardized UTC timestamps across all agents
- Trace ID system for action correlation
- Audit trail compliance requirements

#### **Custom Properties Implementation:**
The system implements 15+ new HubSpot properties:
- **Service Management:** Service Category, Bundle ID, Dependencies
- **Financial Tracking:** Service-specific revenue, bundle discounts
- **Vendor Management:** Processor assignment and status tracking

## Context

### Implementation Timeline & Scope

#### **Current State Analysis (Pre-Implementation):**
